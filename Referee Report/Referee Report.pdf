Referee Report
Hi Yifang I wanted to start by saying that your project on prime numbers is quite impressive. It provides a detailed overview of the history of prime numbers and their significance in mathematics. I appreciate how you have traced the origins of prime number study back to ancient civilizations like the Greeks and Egyptians, highlighting the contributions of Pythagoras, Euclid, Mersenne, Fermat, Euler, and others. The inclusion of definitions, theorems, and algorithms throughout the document helps in understanding the concepts and methods related to prime numbers. Your project succeeds in presenting the evolution of primality testing methods, from classical algorithms like the Sieve of Eratosthenes to probabilistic tests like the Fermat primality test and Miller-Rabin test. The introduction and conclusion effectively frame the importance of prime numbers and their applications in cryptography and other fields. Overall, well done!
As I read through your project, I found the structure very logical and coherent. The flow of information from ancient history to modern methods is well-organized. However, I think it would be beneficial to include more concrete examples or illustrations to supplement the explanations. These examples could help readers grasp the concepts more easily and see the practical applications of prime numbers. Additionally, while you briefly mentioned the importance of prime numbers in cryptography, it would be helpful to further elaborate on their specific applications in this field. Providing some real-world scenarios or explaining how prime numbers are utilized in cryptographic algorithms could enhance the reader's understanding. Also, while the document provides an overview of several primality testing algorithms, it doesn't go into depth for any specific algorithm. This can leave readers wanting more detailed explanations and examples of how these algorithms work. I would suggest selecting one or two key algorithms and delving deeper into their workings, providing step-by-step explanations and even including proofs where applicable. This would give readers a more comprehensive understanding of the algorithms and their underlying mathematical principles. Furthermore, the document lacks formal proofs for the theorems and properties mentioned throughout. While the definitions and statements are provided, including the proofs would add rigor and credibility to the content. It would also help readers follow the logical reasoning behind the theorems and gain a deeper appreciation for the mathematical foundations.
Regarding a list of granular comments: 
- Page 3, Primality Test: "The search for large prime numbers of either form has been the subject of intense study and competition among mathematicians and computer scientists.": It would be helpful to provide a brief explanation or context about why there is a significant interest in finding large prime numbers.
- Page 3, Sieve of Eratosthenes: The algorithm steps are listed, but it would be helpful to include a brief explanation of how the algorithm works and its time complexity.
- Page 4, Fermat primality test: "If the result is not 1, then n is composite.": It should be clarified that "n is likely composite" since the Fermat primality test is probabilistic. 
- Page 5, Miller-Rabin test: "Then n is composite.": Similar to the previous point, it should be clarified that "n is likely composite" since the Miller-Rabin test is also probabilistic.
- Page 5, AKS primality test: "for some small r to simplify it": It would be useful to explain why simplifying the congruence relation modulo a small r is advantageous.
These are some specific points that caught my attention while reviewing your project. I hope you find them helpful in refining your document.
